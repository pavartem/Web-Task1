        <p>Manchester City Football Club is an English football club based in Manchester, that competes in the
            Premier
            League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became
            Ardwick
            Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of
            Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since
            1923.</p>
        <p>Manchester City entered the Football League in 1899, and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in
            1904. It had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and League
            Cup
            under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club
            went
            through a period of decline, which eventually saw them relegated as far down as third tier of English
            football by the end of the 1997–98 season. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and
            have
            remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu
            Dhabi
            United Group for £210 million and received considerable financial investment.</p>

        <p>The club have won six domestic league titles. Under the management of Pep Guardiola they won the Premier
            League in 2018 becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019,
            they
            won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming
            the
            first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[3][4] Manchester City's revenue was the fifth
            highest
            of a football club in the world in the 2017–18 season at €527.7 million.[5][6] In 2018, Forbes estimated
            the
            club was the fifth most valuable in the world at $2.47 billion.</p>

        <p>The club was formed in 1880, under the name of St. Mark's, after an initiative by Arthur Connell (the
            rector
            of St Mark's Church) and his daughter, Anna Connell. After calling them self Gorton FC and Ardwick AFC
            for
            shorter periods, they would change their name to Manchester City in 1894. This coincides with some
            financial
            troubles that eventually led to restructuring of the club. The name change – combined with moving to the
            spacious grounds of Hyde Road a couple of years later – saw Manchester City become the most popular club
            in
            the city, with an enthusiastic fan base that followed them wherever they went. This rise in stature led
            to
            the club earning promotion to the First Division in 1899.</p>
